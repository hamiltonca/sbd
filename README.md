# SBD - Spring Boot Demo

## This project is using Spring Boot 3.3.3

* This project is a simple collection of rest endpoints with PostgreSQL to start.
* My intention is to add Kafka to this project as well.

The project is simply a collection of integrations with the intent of providing some established template
work that can be replicated.

This project was created with the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.com) and then extended.

Still having issues with Lombok and Slf4j. Working on that.
